Some notes:

model:

choices:

list of projects, each with an ID
list of tasks, each with an project ID that the task belongs to
default project == "Misc Actions"?


-- OR --

list of projects/action lists
  projects have many actions




plan:
referece things to each other by IDs

factor all models into a model module
use common model module to structure views
(probably will move all the views into their own view file)
